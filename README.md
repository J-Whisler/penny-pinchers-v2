Penny-Pinchers-v2

Welcome to Penny Pinchers Version 2, the mobile friendly app that helps you save money! Upon your first visit to the site, you will be asked to sign up using your email address, username, and password.  The member page, once you have signed in, will welcome you and display all of the recent bills you will enter.  The first thing that we recommend that you do would be to enter in your budgets for the month.  The navigation button named “Set Budgets” will take you there.  When you click on the dropdown button, 4 choices will appear.  Choose one category, enter your budget amount and click submit (you can edit the amount at any time).   Once your budgets are set, you can click on the “Set Bills” tab.  Here you will have the same dropdown menu with the corresponding categories to enter your expenses.  Under the input for the dollar amount, there is a textbox to enter notes for a description of the expense.  Once you have entered your bills and budgets, you can always check how you are doing by clicking on “Progress”.  The percentage amount shown is in each bar is the calculation of your bills divided by your budget for each category.  The “Leaderboard” button will show you how you stack up against your friends by calculating who is doing the best job of staying under budget.  Finally, you can stay connected with your friends through our chat messenger.  It will show you who is online at any given moment and will instantly send messages to whomever you choose.  Please enjoy Penny Pinchers version 2 and start saving today!
